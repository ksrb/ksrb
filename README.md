### Hi there, I'm [Kevin](https://ksrb.github.io/).

I'm a developer focuesd on the frontend constantly looking for ways to improve and new tools to leverage.

I probably spend too much time [fiddling](https://github.com/ksrb/.files) with IDE's and terminals and if I had a unlimited time I would spend more time configuring [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) than using it. As it is I mostly use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for my day to day and would love to hear what you use.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently getting confused in [Babylon.js](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js)
- âš¡ I'm constantly amazed by the developers in Github
- ðŸ˜… Iâ€™m still figuring out how I feel about these Github stats
